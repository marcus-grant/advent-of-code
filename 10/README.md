# Day 10 - Pipe Maze

## Part One

You use the hang glider to ride the hot air from
Desert Island all the way up to the floating metal island.
This island is surprisingly cold and
there definitely aren't any thermals to glide on,
so you leave your hang glider behind.

You wander around for a while, but you don't find any people or animals.
However, you do occasionally find signposts labeled "Hot Springs" pointing in
a seemingly consistent direction;
maybe you can find someone at the hot springs and
ask them where the desert-machine parts are made.

The landscape here is alien;
even the flowers and trees are made of metal.
As you stop to admire some metal grass,
you notice something metallic scurry away in
your peripheral vision and jump into a big pipe!
It didn't look like any animal you've ever seen;
if you want a better look, you'll need to get ahead of it.

Scanning the area,
you discover that the entire field you're standing on
is densely packed with pipes;
it was hard to tell at first because
they're the same metallic silver color as the "ground".
You make a quick sketch of all of the surface pipes you can see
(your puzzle input).

The pipes are arranged in a two-dimensional grid of tiles:

- `|` is a vertical pipe connecting north and south.
- `-` is a horizontal pipe connecting east and west.
- `L` is a 90-degree bend connecting north and east.
- `J` is a 90-degree bend connecting north and west.
- `7` is a 90-degree bend connecting south and west.
- `F` is a 90-degree bend connecting south and east.
- `.` is ground; there is no pipe in this tile.
- `S` is the starting position of the animal;
  there is a pipe on this tile,
  but your sketch doesn't show what shape the pipe has.

Based on the acoustics of the animal's scurrying,
you're confident the pipe that contains the animal is one large,
continuous loop.

**SIMPLE EXAMPLE NOT USED IN TESTING:**

```txt
.....
.F-7.
.|.|.
.L-J.
.....
```

If the animal had entered this loop in the northwest corner,
the sketch would instead look like this:

```txt
.....
.S-7.
.|.|.
.L-J.
.....
```
